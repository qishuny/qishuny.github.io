Hello!

My name is Qishun Yu. I am interested in controls, motion planning, robot state estimation, and everything about robotics! You can find out more about my past academic projects and research under the [PROJECTS](projects.md) section. For more information, you can visit the [RESUME](cv.md) section and download my latest resume.

Currently, I am a master's student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) majoring in Mechanical Engineering. During my master's study, I have been working at CMU [Robomechanics Lab](https://www.cmu.edu/me/robomechanicslab/). I am currently focusing on implementing a legged robot state estimator on a quadruped robot using an Extended Kalman Filter. Meanwhile, my master thesis is on the locomotion of robots, especially wheeled rovers, in granular media. I propose a novel method of combining a 3D-Resistive Force Theory (3D-RFT) model with a soil deformation model. The new model is implemented in MATLAB and applied to compute forces on wheels at various slip angles and slip ratio conditions.

I received my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering degree from [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/) with minors in Computer Science and Robotics. You can read more about my senior capstone projects on Mars Rover [here](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/news/2021/Rover%20Robotics%20Team%20Sets%20Sights%20on%20Mars%20and%20Beyond.html)!
